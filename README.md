# Python Toy Problem Challenges

This repository contains Python solutions to three toy problem challenges.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Minimum Number of Moves

Given an array representing the number of bricks in each box, determine the minimum number of moves required to distribute the bricks such that each box contains exactly 10 bricks.

### Challenge 2: Maximum Sum of Two Numbers

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum.

### Challenge 3: String Generation

Given an integer `N`, generate a string of length `N` containing as many different lowercase letters ('a' - 'z') as possible, such that each letter occurs an equal number of times.

## How to Use

Each challenge solution is provided in Python. You can find the solutions in the respective files named `challenge_one.py`, `challenge_two.py`, and `challenge_three.py`.

To run the solutions:
